with Stanton Sweeney, 2020-03-13 - Rising From the Ashes Oral Histories","description":"Interview with Stanton Sweeney, current student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Sweeney was a high school student during the time of the fire and shares this perspective. He recounts evacuating from school due to the smoke, and then evacuating from the city. He also shares about returning to his home to find that it had been destroyed in the fires. This is a representative quote from the interview: And actually that night before we went to bed, we were praying for rain, because it had not rained in forever. And it actually ended up raining. And we were going outside, and it started sprinkling. And that was a huge relief. Just knowing that there was rain on the way that could help.","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-stanton-sweeney-2020-03-13","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A75~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Stanton Sweeney, 2020-03-13"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-stanton-sweeney-2020-03-13"},"buildId":"cxDZNYiC7GhEzyGAcTOr1","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
