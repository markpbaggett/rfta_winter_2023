with Randall Brackins, 2020-10-26 - Rising From the Ashes Oral Histories","description":"Interview with Randall Brackins, chief of police for the city of Gatlinburg, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Brackins discusses the challenges faced by the Gatlinburg Police surrounding the wildfires. He recounts first being alerted to the wildfires, and the most pressing concerns for the police on the night of the disaster, and in the following days. This is a representative quote from the interview: \"So we depended on our fellow law enforcement officers from all different areas to help us secure the town. And we did not allow no one in town for a few days because of security and all the dangers that were there, for instance, power lines were downed, trees were down, you couldn't go all the way through different roads or different areas.\"","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-randall-brackins-2020-10-26","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A116~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Randall Brackins, 2020-10-26"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-randall-brackins-2020-10-26"},"buildId":"XbH-ojG1YdmlVyfPbc9jL","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
