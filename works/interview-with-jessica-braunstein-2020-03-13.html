Braunstein discusses her research concerning black bears in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and tracking the animals location. She talks about the response of the black bears to the wildfires, and the aftereffects on the habitat and behavior of the bears. This is a representative quote from the interview: That was something we were curious about, too, was, you know, are [the bears] going to leave their dens? I don't think we had any that are actually in the area that got burned down were denning yet, but we had some right on the outskirts, and they ended up just staying in their dens. They didn't move.","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-jessica-braunstein-2020-03-13","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A70~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Jessica Braunstein, 2020-03-13"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-jessica-braunstein-2020-03-13"},"buildId":"cxDZNYiC7GhEzyGAcTOr1","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
