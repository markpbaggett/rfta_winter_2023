with Zak Goodman-Strauss, 2020-02-22 - Rising From the Ashes Oral Histories","description":"Interview with Zak Goodman-Strauss, resident of Gatlinburg. Goodman-Strauss recounts the day of the fire with regards to the heavy smoke, and his evacuation from the sudden fire. He also discusses returning to his home despite the city still being closed and the tragedy of finding the body of one victim of the fire. This is a representative quote from the interview: So it's just really smoky in Asheville and super dry in Gatlinburg, though I didn't really think about fire here so much, but there was definitely a lot of fire in the air, you know, at the time. And so, so I'd noticed that. There was definitely fires going on already.","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-zak-goodman-strauss-2020-02-22","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A67~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Zak Goodman-Strauss, 2020-02-22"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-zak-goodman-strauss-2020-02-22"},"buildId":"cxDZNYiC7GhEzyGAcTOr1","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
