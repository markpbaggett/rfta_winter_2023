with Lisa and Hannah Oakley, 2020-01-11 - Rising From the Ashes Oral Histories","description":"Interview with Lisa and Hannah Oakley, mother and daughter residents of Gatlinburg. They discuss their life in Gatlinburg before recounting the events of the wildfires. Splitting up during the evacuation, they eventually reunited, and used social media to follow the disaster as it was unfolding. The two also talk about the lasting impact the fire had on individuals and the city as a whole. This is a representative quote from the interview: \"[Gatlinburg] is so cut off from everything else that it's almost like its own little world. You don't expect anything to happen, so I think after [the fire], it made everybody a little bit more aware this stuff really can and will happen, and you can't tell when it's going to.\"","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-lisa-and-hannah-oakley-2020-01-11","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A57~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Lisa and Hannah Oakley, 2020-01-11"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-lisa-and-hannah-oakley-2020-01-11"},"buildId":"cxDZNYiC7GhEzyGAcTOr1","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
