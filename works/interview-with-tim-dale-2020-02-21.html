Dale talks about being in Gatlinburg on the day of the fire to initially cover the smoke and then being reassigned to the fire itself. He discusses that night in Gatlinburg filming the fire and covering the following day at Rocky Top Sports World. This is a representative quote from the interview: \"Seeing a tree fall on a car in front of you was a little disconcerting, I guess is the word I would use, but I was never frightened the whole time.\"","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-tim-dale-2020-02-21","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A64~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Tim Dale, 2020-02-21"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-tim-dale-2020-02-21"},"buildId":"XbH-ojG1YdmlVyfPbc9jL","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
