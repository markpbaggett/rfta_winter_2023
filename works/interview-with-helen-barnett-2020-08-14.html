Barnett discusses the aid provided by her church, the Great Smoky Mountains Church of Christ. The efforts grew from providing water and food to survivors to assisting with bills and large items as people were rebuilding. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: \"Well the emotional changes with people is just taking time. That's why we try to step in as much as we did the financial. They didn't have to worry about that. They could take more care of their selves, their emotional stability.\"","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/rfta_winter_2023/works/interview-with-helen-barnett-2020-08-14","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~rfta%3A108~datastream~TN/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Interview with Helen Barnett, 2020-08-14"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"interview-with-helen-barnett-2020-08-14"},"buildId":"LioHTXsuRp_qW3CysaGv3","assetPrefix":"/rfta_winter_2023","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
